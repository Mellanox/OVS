      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

pdump
=====

.. versionadded:: 2.6.0

.. warning::

   DPDK pdump support is deprecated in OVS and will be removed in next
   releases.

pdump allows you to listen on DPDK ports and view the traffic that is passing
on them. To use this utility, one must have libpcap installed on the system.
Furthermore, DPDK must be built with ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PDUMP=y`` and
``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP=y``. OVS should be built with
``--enable-dpdk-pdump`` configuration option.

.. warning::

   A performance decrease is expected when using a monitoring application like
   the DPDK pdump app.

To use pdump, simply launch OVS as usual, then navigate to the ``app/pdump``
directory in DPDK, ``make`` the application and run like so::

    $ sudo ./build/app/dpdk-pdump -- \
        --pdump port=0,queue=0,rx-dev=/tmp/pkts.pcap

The above command captures traffic received on queue 0 of port 0 and stores it
in ``/tmp/pkts.pcap``. Other combinations of port numbers, queues numbers and
pcap locations are of course also available to use. For example, to capture all
packets that traverse port 0 in a single pcap file::

    $ sudo ./build/app/dpdk-pdump -- \
        --pdump 'port=0,queue=*,rx-dev=/tmp/pkts.pcap,tx-dev=/tmp/pkts.pcap'

.. note::

   ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` environment variable might need to be adjusted to
   OVS runtime directory (``/var/run/openvswitch`` in most cases) for
   ``dpdk-pdump`` utility if OVS started by non-root user.

Many tools are available to view the contents of the pcap file. Once example is
tcpdump. Issue the following command to view the contents of ``pkts.pcap``::

    $ tcpdump -r pkts.pcap

More information on the pdump app and its usage can be found in the `DPDK
documentation`__.
