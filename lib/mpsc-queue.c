/* Multi-producer, single-consumer queue
 * =====================================
 *
 * This an implementation of the MPSC queue described by Dmitri Vyukov [1].
 *
 * One atomic exchange operation is done per insertion.  Removal in most cases
 * will not require atomic operation and will use one atomic exchange to close
 * the queue chain.
 *
 * Insertion
 * =========
 *
 * The queue is implemented using a linked-list.  Insertion is done at the
 * back of the queue, by swapping the current end with the new node atomically,
 * then pointing the previous end toward the new node.  To follow Vyukov
 * nomenclature, the end-node of the chain is called head.  A producer will
 * only manipulate the head.
 *
 * The head swap is atomic, however the link from the previous head to the new
 * one is done in a separate operation.  This means that the chain is
 * momentarily broken, when the previous head still points to NULL and the
 * current head has been inserted.
 *
 * Considering a series of insertions, the queue state will remain consistent
 * and the insertions order is compatible with their precedence, thus the
 * queue is serializable.  However, because an insertion consists in two
 * separate memory transactions, it is not linearizable.
 *
 * Removal
 * =======
 *
 * The consumer must deal with the queue inconsistency.  It will manipulate
 * the tail of the queue and move it along the latest consumed elements.
 * When an end of the chain of elements is found (the next pointer is NULL),
 * the tail is compared with the head.
 *
 * If both points to different addresses, then the queue is in an inconsistent
 * state: the tail cannot move forward as the next is NULL, but the head is not
 * the last element in the chain: this can only happen if the chain is broken.
 *
 * In this case, the consumer must wait for the producer to finish writing the
 * next pointer of its current tail: 'MPSC_QUEUE_RETRY' is returned.
 *
 * Removal is thus in most cases (when there are elements in the queue)
 * accomplished without using atomics, until the last element of the queue.
 * There, the head is atomically loaded. If the queue is in a consistent state,
 * the head is moved back to the queue stub by inserting the stub in the queue:
 * ending the queue is the same as an insertion, which is one atomic XCHG.
 *
 * Limitations
 * ===========
 *
 * The chain will remain broken as long as a producer is not finished writing
 * its next pointer.  If a producer is cancelled for example, the queue could
 * remain broken for any future readings.  This queue should either be used
 * with cooperative threads or outside any cancellable sections.
 *
 * Performances
 * ============
 *
 * In benchmarks this structure was better than alternatives such as:
 *
 *   * A reversed Treiber stack [2], using 1 CAS per operations
 *     and requiring reversal of the node list on removal.
 *
 *   * Michael-Scott lock-free queue [3], using 2 CAS per operations.
 *
 * While it is not linearizable, this queue is well-suited for message passing.
 * If a proper hardware XCHG operation is used, it scales better than
 * CAS-based implementations.
